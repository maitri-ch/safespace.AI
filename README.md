Project: SafeSpace AI â€” offline-first mobile app that detects emotional distress and provides discreet, actionable safety options.

MVP scope:

Discreet text entry + optional voice note.

On-device sentiment & crisis-risk classifier (text-only for MVP).

Escalation detector (simple trend chart + alert).

Discreet UI mode (calculator/notes disguise) + emergency codeword.

Why: Helps people in high-conflict or abusive home environments by providing private recognition of escalation and immediate, contextual safety actions.

Tech highlights: DistilBERT (text), TFLite for on-device inference, Flutter frontend, local encrypted storage.
